# 🧪 OrangeHRM Cypress Automation

This project is a personal initiative to demonstrate my proficiency in end-to-end test automation using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). I chose to automate workflows on the [OrangeHRM Demo Application](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/), a widely used open-source HR management system, as a practical way to showcase real-world testing scenarios.

As a developer and software tester, I created this repository to reflect my understanding of Cypress, testing architecture, and automation best practices. It is intended as a portfolio project to present my capabilities to potential collaborators, employers, or the open-source community.
